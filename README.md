This repository holds some code to run reconstruction tasks based on the fastMRI dataset.

## Overview

This repository is based on a framework built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and inspired by the deep learning framework from the Institute of Machine Learning in Biomedical Imaging : https://github.com/compai-lab/iml-dl. It abstracts away boilerplate code for training, evaluation, and inference tasks while still offering the flexibility of PyTorch for custom modifications. 

It supports the following:
- Model training pipelines (with data preprocessing)
- Experiment tracking (integration with Weights & Biases)
- Model evaluation 

## Installation

First, the dependencies should be installed using pip or the provided conda environment : 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate torch-env
```

## Experiment tracking

By default this template uses WandB as a logging system and tracker for experiment metrics.
To enable this support you should have a free account at [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai) and login with the CLI using :

```bash
wandb login
```

The CLI will ask for the API key that can be found in your wandb account page.


## Running tasks

You can run an task by pointing to its configuration file like :

```bash
python main.py --config_path ./tasks/mnist/config.yaml
```

### Create a custom task

You can define your own tasks by simply following the structure of the default task folder.
Alternatively, if the synforge CLI is installed you can use it to create the necessary files for you :

```bash
synforge generate task
```
